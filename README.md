# python_project_slot_machine
This code simulates a simple slot machine game. Players deposit money, choose how many lines to bet on, and place bets. The slot machine generates random symbols, and if matching symbols align on the selected lines, the player wins according to predefined symbol values. The game continues until the player quits or runs out of money.
